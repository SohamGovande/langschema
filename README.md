# ðŸ§± LangSchema

LangSchema is an open-source project that provides a set of easy-to-use output parsers for large language models. It helps you reduce boilerplate code and provides an efficient way to parse the outputs without the need to write the parsing logic every time. The project currently includes three primary parsers: Binary, Categorize, and List.

No code bloat. One file. Three parsers.

## Features

### Binary Parser
Useful for parsing outputs that are in a binary format, i.e., `true` or `false`.

### Categorize Parser
It assists in parsing outputs that can be categorized into a specific set of strings (enums).

### List Parser
This is intended to parse outputs that are lists of specific set of strings (enums).
