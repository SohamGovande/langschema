# ðŸ§± langschema

**one-line LLM output parsers for JS/TS.** no code bloat. one file. three parsers.

## how it works
```js
import { binary, categorize, list } from 'langschema'

const positive: boolean = await binary('Did this review user like the business? Review: Best bang for your buck.')
const foods: string[] = await list('What foods did this review user like? Review: i loved pizza and milkshakes', ['pizza', 'burger', 'fries'])
const rating: string = await categorize('What rating did this review user give? Review: could NOT recommend it more, best ive ever eaten', ['1 star', '2 stars', '3 stars', '4 stars', '5 stars'])
```
